									<p>Hello, and welcome to my about me page! I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share my passion for pixel art with you. My name is Shahmeer, but you may know me by my artistic pseudonym, Srnahmeer. I chose this name to reflect my creative spirit and add a touch of cleverness to my work.

										For the past three years, I have immersed myself in the world of pixel art, and it has become my true artistic calling. However, my journey in the creative realm began much earlier. I have dabbled in various artistic mediums, including SFX, 3D modeling, 2D art, conceptual art, and even architecture. While exploring these different disciplines, I discovered a deep affinity for pixel art that captivated my imagination like no other.</p>
									<p>Pixel art allows me to bring my ideas to life in a unique and captivating way. I specialize in creating dynamic poses and scenes that capture the essence of a moment, evoking emotions and telling stories through every pixel. It's a medium that challenges me to blend technical precision with artistic creativity, resulting in visually stunning and engaging artwork.

										My dedication to pixel art goes beyond creating individual pieces. I strive to continually learn and grow as an artist, pushing the boundaries of what is possible within the pixel art realm. I constantly seek inspiration from various sources, such as nature, music, and other talented artists. This ongoing exploration enables me to bring fresh perspectives and innovative techniques into my work.</p>
									<p>In addition to my passion for pixel art, I also enjoy sharing my knowledge and skills with others who are interested in the art form. Through workshops, tutorials, and online platforms, I aim to inspire and educate aspiring artists, helping them develop their own unique style and approach.

										I invite you to explore the rest of my page, where you'll find a collection of my artwork that showcases my skills and creativity. Each piece represents a labor of love, and I hope they evoke a sense of wonder and appreciation for the art form. If you have any questions, comments, or would like to collaborate, please don't hesitate to reach out.</p>

									<h2>Goals of Commisioning</h2>
									<p>1. Deliver High-Quality Assets: My primary goal in pixel art game asset commissions is to consistently deliver high-quality artwork that exceeds the client's expectations. I aim to create visually stunning and engaging assets that seamlessly integrate into the client's game, enhancing the overall player experience.</p>
									<p>2. Understand the Client's Vision: I believe in the importance of understanding the client's vision and requirements thoroughly. I strive to establish clear and effective communication channels to ensure that I grasp the essence of their game and artistic preferences. By doing so, I can create pixel art assets that align with their vision and contribute to the cohesive aesthetic of their game. </p>
									<p>3. Collaborative Approach: Collaboration is key in the commission process. I aim to establish a strong working relationship with the client, actively involving them in the creative process. Through regular updates, feedback sessions, and iterative revisions, I ensure that the client's input is valued and incorporated into the final product. This collaborative approach allows us to achieve the desired artistic direction while maintaining a high level of client satisfaction.</p>
									<p>4. Attention to Detail: Pixel art is all about precision and attention to detail. My goal is to meticulously craft each pixel, ensuring that every asset reflects the desired level of detail, style, and consistency. From character sprites and environmental elements to user interface components, I prioritize accuracy and coherence to create visually appealing assets that bring the game world to life.</p>
									<p>5. Timely Delivery: Meeting deadlines is a crucial aspect of any project. I understand the importance of timely delivery, and I strive to manage my workload efficiently, ensuring that I meet the agreed-upon timelines for asset delivery. By maintaining effective project management practices and open communication, I aim to provide clients with peace of mind, knowing that their projects will be completed within the specified time frame.</p>
